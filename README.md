# Wall-NOTES

# This project is a Notes Management System built using Hibernate, JSP, Servlets, Java, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to:

# Add Notes: Create and store new notes with ease.
# Edit Notes: Modify existing notes.
# Delete Notes: Remove notes that are no longer needed.
# View Notes: View all notes in a structured format.
# The application demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and uses Hibernate for database interaction, along with a clean and responsive front-end using HTML and CSS.
